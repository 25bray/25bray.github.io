            <h2>Theodore Roosevelt</h2>
            <p>Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, led a remarkable life marked by his
                dedication to public service and numerous achievements. Born into a wealthy New York family in 1858,
                Roosevelt faced health challenges, including periodic epileptic seizures. Despite this, he pursued an
                active and adventurous life, serving as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, leading the Rough Riders in the
                Spanish-American War, and eventually becoming President. Roosevelt's presidency was defined by
                progressive reforms, including trust-busting and conservation efforts, and he won the Nobel Peace Prize
                for mediating the Russo-Japanese War. Beyond politics, he was a prolific writer, conservationist, and
                advocate for social justice, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to inspire.</p>

        <div id="NapoleonBonaparte">
            <h2>Napoleon Bonaparte</h2>
            <p>Napoleon Bonaparte, born in Corsica in 1769, rose to become Emperor of France during the tumult of the
                French Revolution. Renowned for his military prowess and strategic brilliance, Napoleon expanded the
                French Empire across Europe. Despite battling epilepsy, he led his forces to victory in pivotal battles
                like Austerlitz and Jena-Auerstedt. However, his ambitious campaigns ultimately led to defeat,
                culminating in his exile to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821. Napoleon's legacy as a military genius
                and statesman remains enduring, shaping European history for generations.</p>

        <div id="CharlesDickens">
            <h2>Charles Dickens</h2>
            <p>Charles Dickens, one of the most celebrated English novelists of the Victorian era, was born in 1812 in
                Portsmouth, England. His early life was marked by financial struggles and family hardships, which deeply
                influenced his literary works. Despite facing adversity, Dickens rose to prominence with his vivid
                storytelling and keen social commentary. His novels, including classics such as "Oliver Twist," "Great
                Expectations," and "A Tale of Two Cities," captivated readers with their rich characters and compelling
                narratives, shedding light on the social injustices and inequalities of his time. Despite his literary
                success, Dickens struggled with various health issues throughout his life, including reports of
                epilepsy. Despite these challenges, he continued to write prolifically and advocate for social reform
                until his death in 1870, leaving behind a legacy of timeless literature that continues to resonate with
                readers worldwide.</p>
