        <h1>Epilepsy</h1>
        <h2>What is Epilepsy?</h2>
        <li>Epilepsy is a brain disorder</li>
        <li>It causes you to have seizures</li>
        <li>Most of the time these seizures are caused by flashing lights and other sudden movements.</li>
        <h2>What is a Seizure?</h2>
        <li>During a seizure, there are bursts of electrical activity happening in your brain.</li>
        <li>But seizures are different for everyone that actually has Epilepsy</li>
        <h2>There are a lot of kinds of seizures such as:</h2>
        <li>Tonic-Clonic Seizure</li>
        <li>Tonic Seizure</li>
        <li>Clonic Seizure</li>
        <li>Absence Seizure</li>
        <h2>What is a EEG?</h2>
        <li>Electroencephalography - (EEG) is a test that measures the electrical activity in
            your brain. It's done by placing small sensors on your scalp, which detect the signals coming from your
            brain cells. These signals are then recorded as wavy lines on a computer. Doctors use EEG to check for
            problems like seizures or sleep disorders, and it helps them understand how your brain is working. It's
            painless and doesn't require any needles or injections.
        </li>
        <h2>What are the Seizure First Aid Procedures:</h2>
        <li>Time the seizure</li>
        <li>Check for medical ID</li>
        <li>Keep the person safe during seizure.</li>
        <li>Move or guide them away from harm</li>
        <li>Turn the person onto their SIDE if they are not awake or aware.</li>

        <li>Place something small and soft under their head to prevent head injuries</li>
        <li>Stay with the person until they are awake and alert after the seizure.</li>
        <h2>If or at what point should I call 911?</h2>
